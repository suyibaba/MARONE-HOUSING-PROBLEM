      1.  Will the house be sold within three months of getting listed
      2. How accurately can we estimate the effect of each of the predictor varaibles on the response variable


Logistic Regression will be used to answer this questions
            I used the Sklrearn Library and Statsmodel method to Analyze this 
            
            1.          SKlearn Library 
            
                                                      #first create the classification object
                                                      #then fit that object using the X and Y variable
                                                      #predict the Y variable using the trained classification model   
                              Co efficient was -0.03571865  while intercept was  0.61477516
                              
                              
           2.          Statsmodel
                                                      one drawback of using statmodel is by default, stats model do not use a constant term

##BUSINESS INSIGHTS



      P value represents our confidence level, The results shows Residential area has a very small P value which means we are very confident Residential area has a           impact on our response variable.
      Similarly, all the values which are very small are impacting the response variable. 
      The basic is looking at values less than 5 %.
